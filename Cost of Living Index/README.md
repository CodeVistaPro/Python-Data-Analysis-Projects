# Cost of Living Index Analysis

Welcome to the Cost of Living Index Analysis project! üè†üí∞ This project dives deep into global cost of living data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights through Python-based data analysis and visualization.

üåü **Project Overview**

This project leverages Python and its robust data analysis ecosystem to explore the **Cost of Living Index (CLI)** across the world. The analysis provides:

- **Global Insights:** Identifying countries with the highest and lowest cost of living.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Exploring relationships between key indices like Rent Index and Local Purchasing Power Index.
- **Affordability Index:** Highlighting regions with balanced costs and purchasing power.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping cost of living data to uncover regional disparities.
- **Clustering:** Segmenting countries based on cost indices to reveal economic groupings.

The project demonstrates how data visualization and storytelling can simplify complex global economic patterns, making them accessible and actionable.

üìä **Dataset Details**

- **Source:** The dataset provides comprehensive data on cost of living indices across countries, sourced from publicly available records.

- **Features:**
  - **Country:** Names of countries included in the dataset.
  - **Cost of Living Index:** An aggregate measure of living expenses.
  - **Rent Index:** Housing affordability data.
  - **Cost of Living Plus Rent Index:** A combined metric of living and housing costs.
  - **Groceries Index:** Costs related to food and daily necessities.
  - **Restaurant Price Index:** Dining-out expenses.
  - **Local Purchasing Power Index:** A measure of residents' purchasing power.

This dataset enables in-depth analysis of quantitative and qualitative aspects of global cost of living.

üõ†Ô∏è **Python Libraries Used**

The analysis utilizes Python‚Äôs rich library ecosystem for data manipulation, visualization, and clustering:

- **pandas:** For data cleaning and transformation.
- **numpy:** To perform numerical operations efficiently.
- **matplotlib and seaborn:** For static visualizations, such as bar charts and heatmaps.
- **altair:** To create interactive charts for in-depth exploration.
- **plotly:** For geospatial visualizations like choropleth maps.
- **scikit-learn:** For clustering countries based on indices.

Each library is integral to providing a comprehensive exploration of the dataset.

üîç **Key Insights and Highlights**

### Global Patterns:
- Switzerland, Bahamas, and Iceland rank highest in cost of living due to high rent and grocery expenses.
- Pakistan, Libya, and Egypt rank lowest, offering more affordable living conditions.

### Correlations:
- A strong positive correlation exists between **Cost of Living Index** and **Rent Index**, emphasizing the influence of rent on overall living costs.
- A negative correlation between **Cost of Living Index** and **Local Purchasing Power Index** highlights economic stress in regions with high expenses.

### Affordability Insights:
- The **Affordability Index** identifies countries balancing living costs with income levels, highlighting financially accessible regions.

### Clustering Analysis:
- **Cluster 0:** Affordable regions with lower indices.
- **Cluster 1:** Moderately priced regions.
- **Cluster 2:** Expensive regions like Switzerland and Iceland.

üåê **Visualizations and Techniques**

- **Bar Charts:**
  - Top 5 countries with the highest and lowest Cost of Living Index.
- **Scatter Plots:**
  - Comparing indices like Cost of Living vs. Rent Index.
  - Analyzing Cost of Living Plus Rent Index vs. Local Purchasing Power Index.
- **Heatmaps:**
  - Visualizing correlations between indices.
- **Choropleth Maps:**
  - Mapping Cost of Living Index globally.
- **Boxplots:**
  - Identifying outliers in cost indices.
- **KMeans Clustering:**
  - Grouping countries based on economic factors.

These visualizations provide an intuitive way to understand and interpret the data, catering to both technical and non-technical audiences.

üåà **Why This Project Matters**

Understanding global cost of living patterns has significant implications for:

- **Policy Making:** Informing governments about regional economic disparities.
- **Business Strategy:** Assisting businesses in evaluating regions for expansion or relocation.
- **Public Awareness:** Helping individuals make informed decisions about living and working abroad.

This project underscores the importance of data-driven insights in addressing real-world challenges and showcases Python‚Äôs versatility in data analysis and visualization.

üèÜ **Happy exploring!** üè†üí∞
